<p>The Webiste Crowder Designs is a style page that is made for people who struggle with style. The following links will allow you to be able to look at <a href="style-tips.html">Tips</a> that will allow you to see what is in style this year. Along with that <a href="looking-good-statistics.html">why do you actually need to look good?</a> This helps you understand more fully why is that you need to look good. Most of the other links will help you either contact us or shop on our website!
    This page also has all the links to navigate my website to help achieve a "A" for the semseter in my CIT Class.
