        <p class="ppadding">
            We are a small company that started while my wife and I were in college. We both had an idea that we wanted a better life for ourselves so we started bouncing around ideas. I had an idea that i wanted to start my own clothing line, just because I was a missionary for my church in the beautiful country of England! There I learned so much about style that it was crazy. I use to wear these large baggy pants and didn't know what style was until then. This also led to my success in finding my beautiful wife Kendall. We both have loved being married and are expecting a beautiful daughter.
